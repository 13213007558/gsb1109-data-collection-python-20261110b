.. py:currentmodule:: jsonlines

``jsonlines`` is a Python library to simplify working with jsonlines_
and ndjson_ data.

.. _jsonlines: http://jsonlines.org/
.. _ndjson: https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec

This data format is straight-forward: it is simply one valid JSON
value per line, encoded using UTF-8. While code to consume and create
such data is not that complex, it quickly becomes non-trivial enough
to warrant a dedicated library when adding data validation, error
handling, support for both binary and text streams, and so on. This
small library implements all that (and more!) so that applications
using this format do not have to reinvent the wheel.


Features
========

* Sensible behaviour for most use cases

  * transparently handles ``str`` and ``bytes``, both for input and output
  * supports multiple JSON libraries, e.g. ``json`` (standard library), ``orjson``, ``ujson``
  * transparently handles UTF-8 BOM (if present)
  * useful error messages
  * prevents gotchas, e.g. uses standard-compliant line breaking, unlike `str.splitlines`_

  .. _str.splitlines: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines

* Convenient :py:func:`~jsonlines.open()` function

  * makes simple cases trivial to write
  * takes a file name and a mode
  * returns either a :py:class:`~jsonlines.Reader` or
    :py:class:`~jsonlines.Writer` instance
  * can be used as a context manager

* Flexible :py:class:`~jsonlines.Reader`

  * wraps a file-like object or any other iterable yielding lines
  * can read lines directly via the
    :py:meth:`~jsonlines.Reader.read()` method
  * can be used as an iterator, either directly or via the
    :py:meth:`~jsonlines.Reader.iter()` method
  * can validate data types, including `None` checks
  * can skip invalid lines during iteration
  * supports caller-confirmed read progress with
    :py:meth:`~jsonlines.Reader.acknowledge()` and
    :py:meth:`~jsonlines.Reader.checkpoint()`, for resumable reading
  * provides decent error messages
  * can be used as a context manager
  * allows complete control over decoding using a custom ``loads``
    callable

* Flexible :py:class:`~jsonlines.Writer`

  * wraps a file-like object
  * can produce compact output
  * can sort keys (deterministic output)
  * can flush the underlying stream after each write
  * can be used as a context manager
  * allows complete control over encoding using a custom ``dumps``
    callable

User guide
==========

Import the ``jsonlines`` module to get started:

.. code-block:: python

    import jsonlines


The convenience function :py:func:`jsonlines.open()` takes a file name
and returns either a reader or writer, making simple cases extremely
simple::

  with jsonlines.open('input.jsonl') as reader:
      for obj in reader:
          ...

  with jsonlines.open('output.jsonl', mode='w') as writer:
      writer.write(...)

A :py:class:`Reader` typically wraps a file-like object::

  fp = io.BytesIO(...)  # readable file-like object
  reader = jsonlines.Reader(fp)
  first = reader.read()
  second = reader.read()
  reader.close()
  fp.close()

Instead of a file-like object, any iterable yielding JSON encoded
strings can be provided::

  lines = ['1', '2', '3']
  reader = jsonlines.Reader(lines)

While the :py:meth:`Reader.read` method can be used directly, it is
often more convenient to use iteration::

  for obj in reader:
      ...

Custom iteration flags, such as type checks, can be specified by
calling :py:meth:`Reader.iter()` instead::

  for obj in reader.iter(type=dict, skip_invalid=True):
      ...

A :py:class:`Writer` wraps a file-like object, and can write a single
object, or multiple objects at once::

  fp = io.BytesIO()  # writable file-like object
  writer = jsonlines.Writer(fp)
  writer.write(...)
  writer.write_all([
      ...,
      ...,
      ...,
  ])
  writer.close()
  fp.close()

Both readers and writers can be used as a context manager, in which
case they will be closed automatically. Note that this will not close
a passed-in file-like object since that object’s life span is
controlled by the calling code. Example::

  fp = io.BytesIO()  # file-like object
  with jsonlines.Writer(fp) as writer:
      writer.write(...)
  fp.close()

Note that the :py:func:`jsonlines.open()` function *does* close the
opened file, since the open file is not explicitly opened by the
calling code. That means no ``.close()`` is needed there::

  with jsonlines.open('input.jsonl') as reader:
      ...

This should be enough to get started. See the API docs below for
more details.


Read progress and resumable reading
===================================

When importing records into a database, the records read near the end
of the file may still belong to transactions that have not been
committed when the program exits. To avoid losing or duplicating
those records, reading and *confirmation* are separate steps for
readers opened from a file name:

* :py:meth:`Reader.read` only *delivers* a record;
* :py:meth:`Reader.acknowledge` marks delivered records as durably
  processed, typically after the corresponding database transaction
  has been committed;
* :py:meth:`Reader.checkpoint` returns an immutable
  :py:class:`ReadProgress` token describing the acknowledged input
  span.

Reopening the same file with that token resumes reading right after
the last acknowledged record. Records that were delivered but not
acknowledged are simply delivered again::

  with jsonlines.open('input.jsonl') as reader:
      for obj in reader:
          insert_into_database(obj)
      commit_database()
      progress = reader.acknowledge()

  # later run, possibly after a crash:
  with jsonlines.open('input.jsonl', progress=progress) as reader:
      ...

Acknowledgement can also be limited to a specific physical line
number, e.g. ``reader.acknowledge(reader.lineno)``.

Invalid lines can be acknowledged as consumed with
:py:meth:`Reader.acknowledge_skipped_line`, so progress still
describes a contiguous, explained span of the input. When iterating
with ``iter(skip_invalid=True)`` invalid lines are acknowledged
automatically.

The progress token stores a byte offset, a physical line number, and
a :py:class:`FileFingerprint` containing the resolved path together
with the device and inode numbers. A token can therefore never be
applied to a different file, even one with the same name; doing so
raises :py:class:`ReadProgressMismatchError`. Files that were only
appended to can be resumed without issues, including when the
previously last line did not yet have a line terminator.

Tokens are plain immutable objects and can be serialized (e.g. with
``attrs.asdict``) and stored alongside the imported data.
